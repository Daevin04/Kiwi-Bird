            <p class="padding">- Kiwis sometimes mate and stay together for life. But often if female will find a male she likes better and leave her current spouse. <br>
            Kiwis have one of the largest egg-to-body weight ratios of any bird. On average an egg is 15% of the female's body weight.<br>
            - The female lays one to two eggs at a time, up to three times per year.<br>
            - Eggs have antibacterial and antifungal properties to ward off bacteria and fungi that are common in the soggy areas of New Zealand.<br>
            - The male in the pair will sit on the eggs until they hatch. The incubation period of a kiwi egg is 75 to 85 days.<br>
            Unlike other birds, chicks kick their eggs open and are covered in feathers as soon as they hatch. After a few days, the chick will leave
            the burrow and hang out with dad for around 20 days. After that, they may stay in their parent's territory for a while or trek out to find their own.
            Chicks often don't make it to adulthood. If they do make it to adulthood, they have very long lives and typically live 25 to 50 years.</p><br>
