          <p>Kiwi donâ€™t need pristine native forest, and are found in scrub and rough farmland, exotic plantation forests, sand dunes and snowy tussocks, even mangroves. <br>
            They especially like places with wetland vegetation and that have trees.<br>
            And because they are soil feeders, kiwi prefer places where they can get straight to the dirt, rather than having to probe through the thick leaf litter of a forest floor. Which means they dislike places trampled by livestock because the ground is compacted and hard.</p>

            <h2 class="padding">Diet</h2>
            <p class="padding">Kiwis are omnivores. They munch on worms, grubs, bugs, berries and seeds that they find with their excellent sense of smell. Kiwis are the only birds that have nostrils on the tips of their beaks. Most birds have nostrils closer to their faces.</p><br>
